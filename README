Sharing section of the Social Spider. Adapted from the Spring-Social-Showcase.
TODO: 
- Currently uses Spring-Social-Showcase OAuth tokens due to problems registering app in Twitter and Facebook.
  Find a way to fix that.
- Currently uses Spring-Social-Showcase package names because for some reason I can't get it to work any other way.
  Find a way to make the code more original. Right now it's function over form.
